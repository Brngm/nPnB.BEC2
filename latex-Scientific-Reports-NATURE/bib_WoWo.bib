  abstract = {Graph is an important data representation which appears in a wide diversity of real-world scenarios. Effective graph analytics provides users a deeper understanding of what is behind the data, and thus can benefit a lot of useful applications such as node classification, node recommendation, link prediction, etc. However, most graph analytics methods suffer the high computation and space cost. Graph embedding is an effective yet efficient way to solve the graph analytics problem. It converts the graph data into a low dimensional space in which the graph structural information and graph properties are maximumly preserved. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature in graph embedding. We first introduce the formal definition of graph embedding as well as the related concepts. After that, we propose two taxonomies of graph embedding which correspond to what challenges exist in different graph embedding problem settings and how the existing work addresses these challenges in their solutions. Finally, we summarize the applications that graph embedding enables and suggest four promising future research directions in terms of computation efficiency, problem settings, techniques, and application scenarios.},

abstract = {In recent times, Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SNMF), a derivative of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), has surfaced as a promising technique for graph clustering. Nevertheless, when applied to attributed graph clustering, it confronts notable challenges. These include the disregard for attributed information, the oversight of geometric data point structures, and the inability to discriminate irrelevant features and data outliers. In response, we introduce an innovative extension of SNMF termed Weighted Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (WSNMF). This method introduces node attribute similarity to compute a weight matrix, effectively bridging the gap for attributed graph clustering. Our approach incorporates graph regularization and sparsity constraints to uphold the geometric structure of data points and discern irrelevant features and data outliers. Additionally, we present an updating rule to address optimization complexities and validate algorithmic convergence. Rigorous experimentation on real-world and synthetic networks, employing well-established metrics including F-measure, RI, Modularity, Density, and entropy, substantiates the performance enhancement offered by WSNMF.}

In this article, we provide a systematic review of existing KGE techniques based on representation spaces. Particularly, we build a fine-grained classification to categorise the models based on three mathematical perspectives of the representation spaces: (1) algebraic perspective, (2) geometric perspective and (3) analytical perspective. We introduce the rigorous definitions of fundamental mathematical spaces before diving into KGE models and their mathematical properties. We further discuss different KGE methods over the three categories, as well as summarise how spatial advantages work over different embedding needs. By collating the experimental results from downstream tasks, we also explore the advantages of mathematical space in different scenarios and the reasons behind them. We further state some promising research directions from a representation space perspective, with which we hope to inspire researchers to design their KGE models as well as their related applications with more consideration of their mathematical space properties.},

We also analyse four real-world directed networks, including Google's own web-pages, an email network, a word association graph and the transcriptional regulatory network of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The obtained directed modules are validated by additional information available for the nodes. We find that directed modules of real-world graphs inherently overlap and the investigated networks can be classified into two major groups in terms of the overlaps between the modules. Accordingly, in the word-association network and Google's web-pages, overlaps are likely to contain in-hubs, whereas the modules in the email and transcriptional regulatory network tend to overlap via out-hubs.},

Recent developments have investigated metrics that quantify which parts of the true distribution is modeled well, and, on the contrary, what the model fails to capture, akin to precision and recall in information retrieval. In this paper, we present a general evaluation framework for generative models that measures the trade-off between precision and recall using Renyi divergences. Our framework provides a novel perspective on existing techniques and extends them to more general domains. As a key advantage, this formulation encompasses both continuous and discrete models and allows for the design of efficient algorithms that do not have to quantize the data. We further analyze the biases of the approximations used in practice.},

This article examines the nature of the relationship between Precision and Recall. The relationships between Recall and the number of documents retrieved, between Precision and the number of documents retrieved, and between Precision and Recall are described in the context of different assumptions about retrieval performance. It is demonstrated that a tradeoff between Recall and Precision is unavoidable whenever retrieval performance is consistently better than retrieval at random. More generally, for the Precision–Recall trade-off to be avoided as the total number of documents retrieved increases, retrieval performance must be equal to or better than overall retrieval performance up to that point. Examination of the mathematical relationship between Precision and Recall shows that a quadratic Recall curve can resemble empirical Recall–Precision behavior if transformed into a tangent parabola. With very large databases and/or systems with limited retrieval capabilities there can be advantages to retrieval in two stages: Initial retrieval emphasizing high Recall, followed by more detailed searching of the initially retrieved set, can be used to improve both Recall and Precision simultaneously. Even so, a tradeoff between Precision and Recall remains. © 1994 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Troubles with community detection in networks: No ground truth, no free lunch, and the complex coupling of metadata with structure. Across many scientific domains, there is a common need to automatically extract a simplified view or coarse-graining of how a complex system’s components interact. This general task is called community detection in networks and is analogous to searching for clusters in independent vector data. It is common to evaluate the performance of community detection algorithms by their ability to find so-called ground truth communities. This works well in synthetic networks with planted communities because these networks’ links are formed explicitly based on those known communities. However, there are no planted communities in real-world networks. Instead, it is standard practice to treat some observed discrete-valued node attributes, or metadata, as ground truth. We show that metadata are not the same as ground truth and that treating them as such induces severe theoretical and practical problems. We prove that no algorithm can uniquely solve community detection, and we prove a general No Free Lunch theorem for community detection, which implies that there can be no algorithm that is optimal for all possible community detection tasks. However, community detection remains a powerful tool and node metadata still have value, so a careful exploration of their relationship with network structure can yield insights of genuine worth. We illustrate this point by introducing two statistical techniques that can quantify the relationship between metadata and community structure for a broad class of models. We demonstrate these techniques using both synthetic and real-world networks, and for multiple types of metadata and community structures.}}

	abstract = {This paper reviews the development of the multi-scale methodology in complexity science, and elucidates the importance of understanding complex systems in chemical engineering by discussing the relevance between complex systems and a few challenging problems in this field. Multi-scale structure is considered to be the focus in studying complex systems, particularly, the following four critical issues: correlation between phenomena at different scales, compromise between different dominant mechanisms, coupling between spatial and temporal structural changes and critical phenomena occurring in complex systems. It is considered that complex systems can be formulated as a multi-objective variational problem. The multi-scale methodology is promising in coping with complex systems, which can be descriptive, correlative or variational. It will be reviewed in particular by analyzing the above four critical issues and by showing its 20-year development at IPE from a rough idea to modeling approaches, softwares and finally to industrial applications as well as its extension to a number of chemical and physical systems. The strategy of “from the particular to the general” in developing the variational multi-scale methodology is emphasized, and challenges for mathematicians and physicists are identified to show the necessity of transdisciplinary cooperations. The paper will be concluded by prospects and suggestions.},

	abstract = {Detecting community structure is fundamental for uncovering the links between structure and function in complex networks and for practical applications in many disciplines such as biology and sociology. A popular method now widely used relies on the optimization of a quantity called modularity, which is a quality index for a partition of a network into communities. We find that modularity optimization may fail to identify modules smaller than a scale which depends on the total size of the network and on the degree of interconnectedness of the modules, even in cases where modules are unambiguously defined. This finding is confirmed through several examples, both in artificial and in real social, biological, and technological networks, where we show that modularity optimization indeed does not resolve a large number of modules. A check of the modules obtained through modularity optimization is thus necessary, and we provide here key elements for the assessment of the reliability of this community detection method.},

However, it poorly captures the intrinsically temporal and structural nature of interactions, which calls for a dedicated formalism. In this paper, we generalize graph concepts to cope with both aspects in a consistent way. We start with elementary concepts like density, clusters, or paths, and derive from them more advanced concepts like cliques, degrees, clustering coefficients, or connected components. We obtain a language to directly deal with interactions over time, similar to the language provided by graphs to deal with relations. This formalism is self-consistent: usual relations between different concepts are preserved. It is also consistent with graph theory: graph concepts are special cases of the ones we introduce. This makes it easy to generalize higher level objects such as quotient graphs, line graphs, k-cores, and centralities. This paper also considers discrete versus continuous time assumptions, instantaneous links, and extensions to more complex cases.},

On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks’ dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering.},

Since then, life has continued to forge complex associations between the different emergent levels of interconnection it forms. The advances of recent decades in molecular chemistry and theoretical biology, which have embraced complex systems approaches, now make it possible to conceptualize the questions of the origins of life and its increasing complexity from few fundamental principles developed in the wake of the second-order cybernetics: autopoiesis, RAF networks and closure of constraints. Without resorting to strong reductionism, we show how it is possible to go up the physical levels of organization of matter, from physics to biology and society, based on the formalisms of graph theory and complex networks. This approach of living systems, initiated by Maturana \& Varela (1980) and Kauffman (1986), inevitably leads to a reflection on the nature of cognition; and in the face of the deep changes that affected humanity as a complex systems, on the nature of cultural evolution. Faced with the major challenges that humanity will have to address in the decades to come, this new paradigm invites us to change our conception of causality by shifting our attention from state change to process change and to abandon a widespread notion of "local" causality in favour of complex systems thinking. It also highlights the importance of a better understanding of the influence of social networks, recommendation systems and artificial intelligence on our collective dynamics and social cognition processes.},

In this paper, we address the question identifying the branches of science by taking advantage of the massive digitization of scientific production. In the framework of complex systems studies, we first formalize the notion of level and scale of knowledge dynamics. Then, we demonstrate how we can reconstruct a reasonably precise and concise multi-scale and multi-level approximation of the dynamical structures of Science: phylomemies. We introduce the notion of phylomemetic networks—projections of phylomemies in low dimensional spaces that can be grasped by the human mind—and propose a new algorithm to reconstruct both phylomemies and the associated phylomemetic networks. This algorithm offers, passing, a new temporal clustering on evolving semantic networks. Last, we show how phylomemy reconstruction can take into account users’ preferences within the framework of embodied cognition, thus defining a third way between the quest for objective “ground truth” and the ad-hoc adaptation to a particular user’s preferences. The robustness of this approach is illustrated by several case studies.},

	abstract = {As early as 1912, some warned of the effects of massive CO2 emissions into the atmosphere by the new industrial era. As early as the late 1970s, internal studies by the fossil fuel industries made accurate projections linking global warming to CO2 emissions, predicting at the same time "dramatic environmental effects to come before the year 2050". Meanwhile, these same companies, especially ExxonMobil, tried to convince the public that it was impossible to establish a causal link between fossil fuel use and global warming because the models used to model climate response were too uncertain. Since the 1970s, advances in climate science have provided an increasingly clear statement of the reality of global warming (see IPCC Group I report, Chapter 1), while the 2021 IPCC report states that "there is unequivocal evidence that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land." As global warming intensifies in every region of the world (the year 2022 being emblematic) and its impacts worsen, this decade is critical to resolutely engage in a decrease of greenhouse gas emissions. Despite this, we are witnessing an intensification of the activity of online denialist and climate-skeptic groups and an upward revision of the emission targets of most of the oil majors that have just announced record annual profits (e.g. BP). In France, the intensification of denialist activism has been particularly marked since July 2022, with a triple climate-related news: a series of extreme events, the holding of COP27 with a strong presence of fossil fuel industries, and finally the convergence of global warming issues with those of the security of oil and gas supply due to the war in Ukraine. This study describes some of the strategies implemented by climate skeptic and denialist activists on Twitter to gain influence, quantifies their effects and highlights potential geopolitical motivations alongside the political and economic dimensions already present. It relies on methodologies developed at the CNRS at CAMS and at the Institut des Systèmes Complexes in Paris. Beyond "fact-checking", this study aims at a better understanding of the circulation of different narratives related to climate change and in particular those related to disinformation.},

abstract = {Detecting and analyzing dense groups or communities from social and information networks has attracted immense attention over the last decade due to its enormous applicability in different domains. Community detection is an ill-defined problem, as the nature of the communities is not known in advance. The problem has turned even more complicated due to the fact that communities emerge in the network in various forms such as disjoint, overlapping, and hierarchical. Various heuristics have been proposed to address these challenges, depending on the application in hand. All these heuristics have been materialized in the form of new metrics, which in most cases are used as optimization functions for detecting the community structure, or provide an indication of the goodness of detected communities during evaluation. Over the last decade, a large number of such metrics have been proposed. Thus, there arises a need for an organized and detailed survey of the metrics proposed for community detection and evaluation. Here, we present a survey of the start-of-the-art metrics used for the detection and the evaluation of community structure. We also conduct experiments on synthetic and real networks to present a comparative analysis of these metrics in measuring the goodness of the underlying community structure.},

Confluence becomes a useful tool for defining a new Clustering quality function QConf(G, Γ) for a given Clustering Γ and for defining a new heuristic Starling to find a partitional Clustering of a Graph G intended to optimize the Clustering quality function QConf. We compare the accuracies of Starling, to the accuracies of three state of the art Graphs Clustering methods: Spectral-Clustering, Louvain, and Infomap. These comparisons are done, on the one hand with artificial Graphs (a) Random Graphs and (b) a classical Graphs Clustering Benchmark, and on the other hand with (c) Terrain-Graphs gathered from real data. We show that with (a), (b) and (c), Starling is always able to obtain equivalent or better accuracies than the three others methods. We show also that with the Benchmark (b), Starling is able to obtain equivalent accuracies and even sometimes better than an Oracle that would only know the expected overconnected regions from the Benchmark, ignoring the concretely constructed edges.},

abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.}

It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k -means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.},

abstract = {How do real graphs evolve over time? What are normal growth patterns in social, technological, and information networks? Many studies have discovered patterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a large network or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy tails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena, and others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over time.Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time with the number of edges growing superlinearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time in contrast to the conventional wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)).Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior even at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a forest fire spreading process that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires very few parameters (like the flammability of nodes), and produces graphs exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the present study.We also notice that the forest fire model exhibits a sharp transition between sparse graphs and graphs that are densifying. Graphs with decreasing distance between the nodes are generated around this transition point.Last, we analyze the connection between the temporal evolution of the degree distribution and densification of a graph. We find that the two are fundamentally related. We also observe that real networks exhibit this type of relation between densification and the degree distribution.},

abstract = {Abstract Cluster analysis is a statistical technique that sorts observations into similar sets or groups. The use of cluster analysis presents a complex challenge because it requires several methodological choices that determine the quality of a cluster solution. This paper chronicles the application of cluster analysis in strategic management research, where the technique has been used since the late 1970s to investigate issues of central importance. Analysis of 45 published strategy studies reveals that the implementation of cluster analysis has been often less than ideal, perhaps detracting from the ability of studies to generate knowledge. Given these findings, suggestions are offered for improving the application of cluster analysis in future inquiry.},

abstract = {Analysis of fMRI time series is often performed by extracting one or more parameters for the individual voxels. Methods based, e.g., on various statistical tests are then used to yield parameters corresponding to probability of activation or activation strength. However, these methods do not indicate whether sets of voxels are activated in a similar way or in different ways. Typically, delays between two activated signals are not identified. In this article, we use clustering methods to detect similarities in activation between voxels. We employ a novel metric that measures the similarity between the activation stimulus and the fMRI signal. We present two different clustering algorithms and use them to identify regions of similar activations in an fMRI experiment involving a visual stimulus.}

abstract = {Abstract Clustering functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series has emerged in recent years as a possible alternative to parametric modeling approaches. Most of the work so far has been concerned with clustering raw time series. In this contribution we investigate the applicability of a clustering method applied to features extracted from the data. This approach is extremely versatile and encompasses previously published results [Goutte et al., 1999] as special cases. A typical application is in data reduction: as the increase in temporal resolution of fMRI experiments routinely yields fMRI sequences containing several hundreds of images, it is sometimes necessary to invoke feature extraction to reduce the dimensionality of the data space. A second interesting application is in the meta-analysis of fMRI experiment, where features are obtained from a possibly large number of single-voxel analyses. In particular this allows the checking of the differences and agreements between different methods of analysis. Both approaches are illustrated on a fMRI data set involving visual stimulation, and we show that the feature space clustering approach yields nontrivial results and, in particular, shows interesting differences between individual voxel analysis performed with traditional methods.

Our method obtains feature re-scaling factors taking into account the structure of a given data set and the intuitive idea that different features may have different degrees of relevance at different clusters. We experiment with the Silhouette (using squared Euclidean, Manhattan, and the pth power of the Minkowski distance), Dunn’s, Calinski–Harabasz and Hartigan indexes on data sets with spherical Gaussian clusters with and without noise features. We conclude that our methods indeed increase the chances of estimating the true number of clusters in a data set.}

First we show the completeness of SIMPLE MAX CUT (MAX CUT with edge weights restricted to value 1), and, as a corollary, the completeness of the OPTIMAL LINEAR ARRANGEMENT problem. We then show that even if the domains of the NODE COVER and DIRECTED HAMILTONIAN PATH problems are restricted to planar graphs, the two problems remain NP-complete, and that these and other graph problems remain NP-complete even when their domains are restricted to graphs with low node degrees. For GRAPH 3-COLORABILITY, NODE COVER, and UNDIRECTED HAMILTONIAN CIRCUIT, we determine essentially the lowest possible upper bounds on node degree for which the problems remain NP-complete.},

  abstract = 	 {This paper investigates graph clustering in the planted cluster model in the   presence of  \em small clusters. Traditional results dictate that for an   algorithm to provably correctly recover the clusters, \em all clusters must be   sufficiently large (in particular, \tildeΩ(\sqrtn) where n is the number   of nodes of the graph). We show that this is not really a restriction: by a more refined   analysis of the trace-norm based matrix recovery approach proposed in (Jalali et al. 2011) and (Chen et al. 2012), we prove that small clusters, under certain mild assuptions, do not hinder recovery of large ones.  Based on this result, we further devise an iterative algorithm   to recover \em almost all clusters via a “peeling strategy”, i.e., recover large clusters   first, leading to a reduced problem, and repeat this procedure.   These results are extended to the    \em partial observation setting, in which only a (chosen) part of the graph is observed.  The peeling strategy gives rise to an active learning algorithm, in which   edges adjacent to smaller clusters are queried more often as large clusters are learned  (and removed).  Our findings are supported by experiments.    From a high level, this paper sheds novel insights on high-dimesional statistics and   learning structured data, by presenting a structured matrix learning problem for which  a one shot convex relaxation approach necessarily fails, but a carefully constructed sequence of convex relaxations  does the job.}

Despite the large variety of methods proposed to detect communities in graphs, there is a big need for multi-purpose techniques, able to handle different types of datasets and the subtleties of community structure. In this paper we present OSLOM (Order Statistics Local Optimization Method), the first method capable to detect clusters in networks accounting for edge directions, edge weights, overlapping communities, hierarchies and community dynamics. It is based on the local optimization of a fitness function expressing the statistical significance of clusters with respect to random fluctuations, which is estimated with tools of Extreme and Order Statistics. OSLOM can be used alone or as a refinement procedure of partitions/covers delivered by other techniques. We have also implemented sequential algorithms combining OSLOM with other fast techniques, so that the community structure of very large networks can be uncovered. Our method has a comparable performance as the best existing algorithms on artificial benchmark graphs. Several applications on real networks are shown as well. OSLOM is implemented in a freely available software (http://www.oslom.org), and we believe it will be a valuable tool in the analysis of networks.},

  abstract = {{Community structure is one of the most important features of real networks and reveals the internal organization of the nodes. Many algorithms have been proposed but the crucial issue of testing, i.e., the question of how good an algorithm is, with respect to others, is still open. Standard tests include the analysis of simple artificial graphs with a built-in community structure, that the algorithm has to recover. However, the special graphs adopted in actual tests have a structure that does not reflect the real properties of nodes and communities found in real networks. Here we introduce a class of benchmark graphs, that account for the heterogeneity in the distributions of node degrees and of community sizes. We use this benchmark to test two popular methods of community detection, modularity optimization, and Potts model clustering. The results show that the benchmark poses a much more severe test to algorithms than standard benchmarks, revealing limits that may not be apparent at a first analysis.}},

Power laws appear widely in physics, biology, earth and planetary sciences, economics and finance, computer science, demography and the social sciences. For instance, the distributions of the sizes of cities, earthquakes, forest fires, solar flares, moon craters and people's personal fortunes all appear to follow power laws. The origin of power-law behaviour has been a topic of debate in the scientific community for more than a century. Here we review some of the empirical evidence for the existence of power-law forms and the theories proposed to explain them.",

The techniques presented here will advance the application of complex network theory by allowing reliable estimation of power-law models from data and further allowing quantitative assessment of goodness-of-fit of proposed power-law models to empirical data.",

	abstract = "Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the empirical detection and characterization of power laws is made difficult by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution. In particular, standard methods such as least-squares fitting are known to produce systematically biased estimates of parameters for power-law distributions and should not be used in most circumstances. Here we describe statistical techniques for making accurate parameter estimates for power-law data, based on maximum likelihood methods and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. We also show how to tell whether the data follow a power-law distribution at all, defining quantitative measures that indicate when the power law is a reasonable fit to the data and when it is not. We demonstrate these methods by applying them to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines. Each of the data sets has been conjectured previously to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.",

abstract = {Maximizing the quality index modularity has become one of the primary methods for identifying the clustering structure within a graph. Since many contemporary networks are not static but evolve over time, traditional static approaches can be inappropriate for specific tasks. In this work, we pioneer the NP-hard problem of online dynamic modularity maximization. We develop scalable dynamizations of the currently fastest and the most widespread static heuristics and engineer a heuristic dynamization of an optimal static algorithm. Our algorithms efficiently maintain a modularity-based clustering of a graph for which dynamic changes arrive as a stream. For our quickest heuristic we prove a tight bound on its number of operations. In an experimental evaluation on both a real-world dynamic network and on dynamic clustered random graphs, we show that the dynamic maintenance of a clustering of a changing graph yields higher modularity than recomputation, guarantees much smoother clustering dynamics, and requires much lower runtimes. We conclude with giving sound recommendations for the choice of an algorithm.},

Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.},

  abstract = {There is a wide set of evaluation metrics available to compare the quality of text clustering algorithms. In this article, we define a few intuitive formal constraints on such metrics which shed light on which aspects of the quality of a clustering are captured by different metric families. These formal constraints are validated in an experiment involving human assessments, and compared with other constraints proposed in the literature. Our analysis of a wide range of metrics shows that only BCubed satisfies all formal constraints. We also extend the analysis to the problem of overlapping clustering, where items can simultaneously belong to more than one cluster. As Bcubed cannot be directly applied to this task, we propose a modified version of Bcubed that avoids the problems found with other metrics.},
