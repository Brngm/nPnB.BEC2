In a recent paper(1), we proposed a unified theoretical framework **nPnB** defined for the evaluation of graph clusterings with respect to the following two properties:

* PDC : Each community is Densely Connected;

* PWC : Communities are Weakly Connected to each other.
  
I propose here **BEC.2**, a fast and relevant Multi-Scale Graph Clustering algorithm in **nPnB** framework.
