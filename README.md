In a recent paper(1), we proposed a unified theoretical framework **nPnB** defined for the evaluation of graph clusterings with respect to the following two properties:

  **PDC : Each community is Densely Connected;**
  
  **PWC : Communities are Weakly Connected to each other.**
  
In **nPnB** framework, I propose here **BEC.2**, a fast and relevant Multi-Scale Graph Clustering algorithm.
